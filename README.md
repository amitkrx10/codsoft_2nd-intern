1. Iris Flower Classification
Description: A classic classification task to predict the species of iris flowers based on their physical measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).

Techniques Used:

Data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Data preprocessing

Machine Learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM)

Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)






2. Sales Prediction Using Python
Description: Predicting future sales based on historical data. This helps in planning inventory, production, and business strategy.

Techniques Used:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis

Time series analysis and regression models

Visualization of trends and predictions





3. Titanic Survival Prediction
Description: Predicting which passengers survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning, based on features like age, gender, class, etc.

Techniques Used:

Data wrangling and feature engineering

Handling missing values

Applying classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest)

Model performance analysis
